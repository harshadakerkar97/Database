Assignment - 13
---------------------
1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others will have the words “Low Rating”.
ANS -	select cname,city,("High rating") rating from customers where rating >= 200
    	union
    	select cname,city,("Low Rating") rating from customers where rating < 200;	

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.  
ANS -	select snum number,sname from salepeople where snum in(select snum from orders group by snum having count(*)>1)  
	union 
	select cnum,cname from customers where cnum in(select cnum from orders group by cnum having count(cnum)>1) order by sname;

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any redundancies between either of them and the first. (Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the point.)
ANS -	select snum from salepeople where city='san jose'
    	union
    	select cnum from customers where city='san jose'
    	union all
    	select onum from orders where odate like '%10-03';
